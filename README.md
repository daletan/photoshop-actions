# photoshop-actions

My name's Dale and I'm an architectural photogapher at [High Rise Photo](https://www.highrisephoto.com). I also happen to be a computer engineer in my past career, and I recognize the value in sharing and distributing knowledge.

/**Photoshop Actions**/ is a set of actions that I commonly use in Photoshop for my day-to-day workflows. The actions were created around the concept of a Photoshop master file, and are designed to be non-destructive wherever possible.

## Overview
These actions have been grouped into 3 sets:
* **Photo Basic Edits** - Sets up basic layers to initiate processing, starts dodging and burning layer, scrubs blue cast in shadows, etc.
* **Color Correction** - For color casts correction. Based on this video https://youtu.be/09XC9WGTLyc. Run the action to set a group up, then sample a spot in the highlights, and run that action to correct for the casts. Adjust opacity of the layer to taste. Repeat for highlights and mid-tones.
* **Printing** - Actions for printing. Convert to the bit-depth for the printer (typically 8-bit), then (manually) resize, setting resolution to 300dpi. Finish by adding print sharpening, and then correct to white and black points for the paper being used. 

## Installation
Just download and drag the .atn files into Photoshop. Alternatively, click on the top-right dropdown in Photoshop's action panel, and "Load actions".

## Usage
In the Actions panel, click on the action to run, and hit the "Play" button at the bottom of that panel.
